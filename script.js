/*!Tasks:
Create a new index.html and script.js in order to complete the following tasks:

1. Add two buttons with IDs showButton and hideButton. 
Add an image with the ID myImage and set its display style 
to none initially so it's hidden when the page loads.
 
2. Use CSS to set the initial display property of 
the image to none.
 
3. Get references to the buttons and the image using 
getElementById.

4. Add an event listener to the "Show" button that 
sets the display property of the image to block when clicked.

5 Add an event listener to the "Hide" button that sets 
the display property of the image to none when clicked.*/
